To install the source code, simply download the py file in the src folder which is a python file that I exported from pyCharm. 
To build the code, simply open the file named scr to pyCharm, and the entire code are built.
To run the code, after opening the code in pyCharm, you should download the shakespeare-scenes.json to your local computer. And click the run button on top, and the code will run.

In this project, multiple queries are being searched among the Shakespeare's play and analysis was made on the result.
This is a part of a search engine model that I built.
